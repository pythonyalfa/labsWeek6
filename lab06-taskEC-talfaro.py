# Oh no! The nefarious Doctor Doom is planning on hacking into the satellite broadcasting
# system to spread his maniacal message of misdoing across the planet. We need to
# make sure that he can’t get his way! Use what you learned in this section about Python
# in order to create some sort of super secret security script that will let the technicians
# access the system but keep that diabolical delinquent Doom locked out!
# Your script should take in a four digit code, check each of the digits, and then, assuming
# they are all correct, grant access to the system.If only some of the digits are correct, the
# script should output how many of the digits are correct,just in case the technicians
# have forgotten some of the code. With your help, Doom doesn’t stand a chance!
