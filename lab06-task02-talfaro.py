# Task 02
# Write a Python script that will continually prompt for a string in the following format and
# do the necessary calculations based on the given operator using a separate function for
# each operator. It should be able to perform addition,subtraction, multiplication, division,
# exponentiation (where first number is base and second is power), modulo.
# Input string                                  Expected output of script
# Enter calculation: add 1 2 3 4                Sum: 10
# Enter calculation: sub 20 30 100 50           Difference: -160
# Enter calculation: mul 60 7                   Product: 420
# Enter calculation: div 10 5                   Quotient: 2
# Enter calculation: exp 3 2                    Power: 9
# Enter calculation: mod 3 12                   Modulus: 3
